					<span class='serifFont'>Discordant Projects </span>is a multidisciplinary practice centering around public engagement and design research. Founded in 2015 by <a href="https://www.nova-on-site.com/" target="_blank">Nova Olson</a>, <a href="http://pefung.co/" target="_blank">Pete Fung Ho Ching</a> and <a href="">Samein Shamsher</a>, the collective produces workshops, curatorial frameworks, and public facing interventions. Collaborating with community members, cultural institutions and skilled practitioners, their work focuses on specific social contexts that helps citizens recognize how small, everyday actions of lived experience influence broader systems of interdependence. Their practice is built upon designing <em>with</em> people, rather than for others.

	<!-- OCEAN CONFESSIONAL -->

	<div id="section_1"  class="gridContainer  invisible">	
		<div class="project_description">
			<p><span class='serifFont'>Ocean Confessional</span> is a facilitated experience where we invite passersby to reconsider their relationship with the ocean. With the ocean acting as confessor, citizens expressed and sought forgiveness of past and present environmental transgressions. This was mediated through the use of a piece of water-soluble paper, each containing a small amount of calcium-carbonate that helps to slow down the acidification of our oceans. Imagined as a new form of public ceremony, <span class='serifFont'>Ocean Confessional </span> aims to create a more nuanced, open and ongoing dialogue about how our everyday actions are impacting the ocean’s health.</p>
			<p>
				Begun as a collaborative initiative with <a href="https://desis.ecuad.ca/" target="_blank">Emily Carr DESIS</a> and the <a href="https://www.livingoceans.org/" target="_blank">Living Oceans Society </a>, our goal was to explore our collective empathy with non-human subjects. The narratives surrounding pro-environmental campaigns are often limited, oscillating between optimistic feel good solutions or cynical guilty shaming messages. Rarely is there room for individuals to participate and shape these narratives. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="serifFont">Ocean Confessional</span> was first enacted in Vancouver in 2016 and was the recipient of the Ecological Design Award in the same year. An expanded version was commissioned by <span class="serifFont">Helsinki Design Museum </span>, and generously funded by <a href="http://www.verkkoviestin.fi/lionshkifinlandia/ajankohtaista/" target="_blank">Lions Club Helsinki Finlandia</a>.It was exhibited at the <span class="serifFont">Helsinki Design Week</span> as part of the <a href="https://www.designmuseum.fi/en/exhibitions/design-club-open-call-2-critical-design/#:~:text=Critical%20Tide%20exhibition%20will%20open,engagement%20within%20the%20exhibition%20space." target="_blank">Critical Tides</a> exhibition in 2019.

				<p>A four day museum, from inception to death.</p>
				<p>Roaming between the lobbies of a Sheraton Hotel, and the Vancouver Art Gallery, <span class="serifFont">When is a museum?</span> was commissioned by the <a href="https://www.museweb.net/">Museums and the Web</a> to explore how a museum could be collectively reimagined, performed and pried open for discussion. Acting as concerned amateur museumologist, we collected, archived and reproduced the artefacts donated by event goers - themselves professionals functioning in various roles within museums across the globe - simultaneously displaying the collection while giving the items new life as souvenirs.  
				</p>
				<p>From stolen Whitney Museum property to a Splenda package from the 1970s, a friendship ring to the intangible heritage cakes from Hong Kong, each object’s personal story lays bare our constant urge to reconnect with lived experience through the objects that make up our everyday life. Read together, these acts highlight the complex intertextual nature of a museum while laying bare the colonial premises, classificatory systems, logics, and structural conventionally connected to the institution. Ultimately asking <span class="serifFont">When is a Museum? </span></p>

					<span class='serifFont'>Spaces in Exchange</span> is a self-initiated pedagogical and curatorial project in partnership with <a href="https://socai.org/">The School of Collaboration and Invention</a>. A studio framework and curriculum was developed to host 21 first-year art students, who together examined the various ways art and design can become a catalyst for social change. Over the course of six weeks, we unpacked common and forgotten rituals of daily actions, the social dimension of ubiquitous objects and spaces, and how these come together to connect us to larger social systems of exchange. The students organized themselves into five thematic groups, each of which developed one participatory installation that addressed diverse, topical issues in our contemporary lives. The resulting projects were performed as part of an exhibition entitled <span class="serifFont">Spaces in Exchange</span>, which took place alongside the end of year, Foundation Show. The works created a disruptive element, problematizing the notion of what is permissible within traditional art exhibitions.

					<span class='serifFont'>Space in Exchange </span>was generously supported by the Creative Spark grant from <a href="https://artstarts.com/home">Artstarts</a>.
