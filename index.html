					<span class='serifFont'>Discordant Projects </span>is a multidisciplinary practice centering around public engagement and design research. Founded in 2015 by <a href="https://www.nova-on-site.com/" target="_blank">Nova Olson</a>, <a href="http://pefung.co/" target="_blank">Pete Fung Ho Ching</a> and <a href="">Samein Shamsher</a>, the collective produces workshops, curatorial frameworks, and public facing interventions. Collaborating with community members, cultural institutions and skilled practitioners, their work focuses on specific social contexts that helps citizens recognize how small, everyday actions of lived experience influence broader systems of interdependence. Their practice is built upon designing <em>with</em> people, rather than for others.

			<p><span class='serifFont'>Ocean Confessional</span> is a facilitated experience where we invite passersby to reconsider their relationship with the ocean. With the ocean acting as confessor, citizens expressed and sought forgiveness of past and present environmental transgressions. This was mediated through the use of a piece of water-soluble paper, each containing a small amount of calcium-carbonate that helps to slow down the acidification of our oceans. Imagined as a new form of public ceremony, <span class='serifFont'>Ocean Confessional </span> aims to create a more nuanced, open and ongoing dialogue about how our everyday actions are impacting the ocean’s health.</p>
			<p>
				Begun as a collaborative initiative with <a href="https://desis.ecuad.ca/" target="_blank">Emily Carr DESIS</a> and the <a href="https://www.livingoceans.org/" target="_blank">Living Oceans Society </a>, our goal was to explore our collective empathy with non-human subjects. The narratives surrounding pro-environmental campaigns are often limited, oscillating between optimistic feel good solutions or cynical guilty shaming messages. Rarely is there room for individuals to participate and shape these narratives.

				<span class="serifFont">Ocean Confessional</span> was first enacted in Vancouver in 2016 and was the recipient of the Ecological Design Award in the same year. An expanded version was commissioned by <span class="serifFont">Helsinki Design Museum </span>, and generously funded by <a href="http://www.verkkoviestin.fi/lionshkifinlandia/ajankohtaista/" target="_blank">Lions Club Helsinki Finlandia</a>.It was exhibited at the <span class="serifFont">Helsinki Design Week</span> as part of the <a href="https://www.designmuseum.fi/en/exhibitions/design-club-open-call-2-critical-design/#:~:text=Critical%20Tide%20exhibition%20will%20open,engagement%20within%20the%20exhibition%20space." target="_blank">Critical Tides</a> exhibition in 2019.
