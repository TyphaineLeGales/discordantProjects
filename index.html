			Discordant Projects is a multidisciplinary practice centering around public engagement and design research. Founded in 2015 by Nova Olson, Pete Fung Ho Ching and Samein Shamsher, the collective produces workshops, curatorial frameworks, and public facing interventions. Collaborating with community members, cultural institutions and skilled practitioners, their work focuses on specific social contexts that helps citizens recognize how small, everyday actions of lived experience influence broader systems of interdependence. Their practice is built upon designing with people, rather than for others.
