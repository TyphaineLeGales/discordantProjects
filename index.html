					<span class='serifFont'>Discordant Projects </span>is a multidisciplinary practice centering around public engagement and design research. Founded in 2015 by <a href="https://www.nova-on-site.com/" target="_blank">Nova Olson</a>, <a href="http://pefung.co/" target="_blank">Pete Fung Ho Ching</a> and <a href="">Samein Shamsher</a>, the collective produces workshops, curatorial frameworks, and public facing interventions. Collaborating with community members, cultural institutions and skilled practitioners, their work focuses on specific social contexts that helps citizens recognize how small, everyday actions of lived experience influence broader systems of interdependence. Their practice is built upon designing <em>with</em> people, rather than for others.

	<!-- OCEAN CONFESSIONAL -->

	<div id="section_1"  class="gridContainer section invisible">	
		<div class="project_description">
			<p><span class='serifFont'>Ocean Confessional</span> is a facilitated experience where we invite passersby to reconsider their relationship with the ocean. With the ocean acting as confessor, citizens expressed and sought forgiveness of past and present environmental transgressions. This was mediated through the use of a piece of water-soluble paper, each containing a small amount of calcium-carbonate that helps to slow down the acidification of our oceans. Imagined as a new form of public ceremony, <span class='serifFont'>Ocean Confessional </span> aims to create a more nuanced, open and ongoing dialogue about how our everyday actions are impacting the ocean’s health.</p>
			<p>
				Begun as a collaborative initiative with <a href="https://desis.ecuad.ca/" target="_blank">Emily Carr DESIS</a> and the <a href="https://www.livingoceans.org/" target="_blank">Living Oceans Society </a>, our goal was to explore our collective empathy with non-human subjects. The narratives surrounding pro-environmental campaigns are often limited, oscillating between optimistic feel good solutions or cynical guilty shaming messages. Rarely is there room for individuals to participate and shape these narratives. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="serifFont">Ocean Confessional</span> was first enacted in Vancouver in 2016 and was the recipient of the Ecological Design Award in the same year. An expanded version was commissioned by <span class="serifFont">Helsinki Design Museum </span>, and generously funded by <a href="http://www.verkkoviestin.fi/lionshkifinlandia/ajankohtaista/" target="_blank">Lions Club Helsinki Finlandia</a>.It was exhibited at the <span class="serifFont">Helsinki Design Week</span> as part of the <a href="https://www.designmuseum.fi/en/exhibitions/design-club-open-call-2-critical-design/#:~:text=Critical%20Tide%20exhibition%20will%20open,engagement%20within%20the%20exhibition%20space." target="_blank">Critical Tides</a> exhibition in 2019.

		<!-- WHEN IS A MUSEUM ? -->

		<div id="section_2" class="gridContainer section invisible">

				<p>A four day museum, from inception to death.</p>
				<p>Roaming between the lobbies of a Sheraton Hotel, and the Vancouver Art Gallery, <span class="serifFont">When is a museum?</span> was commissioned by the <a href="https://www.museweb.net/">Museums and the Web</a> to explore how a museum could be collectively reimagined, performed and pried open for discussion. Acting as concerned amateur museumologist, we collected, archived and reproduced the artefacts donated by event goers - themselves professionals functioning in various roles within museums across the globe - simultaneously displaying the collection while giving the items new life as souvenirs.  
				</p>
				<p>From stolen Whitney Museum property to a Splenda package from the 1970s, a friendship ring to the intangible heritage cakes from Hong Kong, each object’s personal story lays bare our constant urge to reconnect with lived experience through the objects that make up our everyday life. Read together, these acts highlight the complex intertextual nature of a museum while laying bare the colonial premises, classificatory systems, logics, and structural conventionally connected to the institution. Ultimately asking <span class="serifFont">When is a Museum? </span></p>

		<!-- SPACES IN EXCHANGE -->

		<div id="section_3" class="gridContainer section invisible">
			<div class="project_description">
				<p>
					<span class='serifFont'>Spaces in Exchange</span> is a self-initiated pedagogical and curatorial project in partnership with <a href="https://socai.org/">The School of Collaboration and Invention</a>. A studio framework and curriculum was developed to host 21 first-year art students, who together examined the various ways art and design can become a catalyst for social change. Over the course of six weeks, we unpacked common and forgotten rituals of daily actions, the social dimension of ubiquitous objects and spaces, and how these come together to connect us to larger social systems of exchange. The students organized themselves into five thematic groups, each of which developed one participatory installation that addressed diverse, topical issues in our contemporary lives. The resulting projects were performed as part of an exhibition entitled <span class="serifFont">Spaces in Exchange</span>, which took place alongside the end of year, Foundation Show. The works created a disruptive element, problematizing the notion of what is permissible within traditional art exhibitions.

		<div id="section_4" class="gridContainer section invisible">
			<div class="project_description">
				<p>Commissioned by the <a href="https://research.ecuad.ca/healthdesignlab/about/">Health Design Lab</a>, and in partnership with <a href="https://kgms.ca/">Kenneth Gordon Maplewood School</a>, <span class="serifFont">Anywhere Everywhere</span> is a year-long design research project investigating the spatial needs of students with learning differences, and the often neglected social-emotional elements of the Canadian elementary school curriculum.  </p>
				<p>Working as part of an interdisciplinary team, including child psychologists, behavioural learning experts, special needs teachers, and students themselves, we established an in-situ lab. Throughout the academic year, the lab designed and facilitated numerous workshops, and learning activities. Students became video-journalists, interviewing staff and faculty about their own emotions. They helped to develop programming to make visible unconventional or unacknowledged safe-spaces for their fellow students. They questioned the one-directional nature of learning by taking on the role of both students and educators as part of choreographed <span class="serifFont">Meltdown Drills</span> performed throughout the school. Ultimately the work seeks to test the boundaries of traditional educational spaces, empowering students to better understand and discuss their emotions and those of their peers and teachers. 
				</p>
				<p>Our initial year-long research project was expanded into a studio, with <a href="http://clothingasconversation.com/">Helene Day Fraser</a>, for bachelor design students at Emily Carr University to further interpret and respond to our findings and design proposals.</p>

		<!-- FUTURE SOCIETY OF CHINA -->

		<div id="section_5" class="gridContainer section invisible">
			<div class="project_description">
				<p>Commissioned by <a href="https://centrea.org/">Centre A</a>, and the <span class="serifFont">City of Vancouver</span> to reimagine the space of a Chinatown Night Market stall as a platform for community engagement. Drawing inspiration from the fraternal and kinship organizations that emerged in Chinatown over the last century, 未來宗親會/The Futures Society of Chinatown seeks to reframe the on-going struggle of gentrification and change which has marked the recent history of the neighbourhood.</p>
				<p>The research took the form of ethnographic interviews, tapping into informal information channels, community knowledge of multi-generational shop-owners, and community leaders. From a calligrapher disguised as a cafe owner, to new-wave skater-punks fostering at-risk youth, the recent historiography of Chinatown was mapped out in order to discover unexpected connections and future trajectories. </p>
				<p>Over three weekends, the Night Market stall then was transformed into a temporary gathering hall for the inaugural meeting of our new, and possible last, kinship association. While signing up new members, a uniquely developed nostalgia-cleansing tea was served, alongside a multi-lingual conversational manual involving customized futuring-tools. Through these series of interventions local residents, new and old, were invited to challenge current conventions of what the future may hold for their neighbourhood.</p>

			<!-- UNFINISHED STORIS -->
		<div id="section_6" class="gridContainer section invisible">
			<div class="project_description">
				<p>Developed as a personal inquiry into the state of current news consumption, <span class="serifFont">unfinished stories</span> takes the form of a mobile installation, challenging our understanding of what it means to be informed. Audiences are invited to become the editors-in-chief of their own, individualized newspaper. Selecting from an ever changing menu of headlines and illustrations, participants piece together fragmented stories, cut short by the necessity of print media. Their paper is then printed on the spot through the use of specialized custom fabricated stamps.</p>
				<p>With unfinished stories, we brought together several organizations and people whose histories and practices are tied together by the medium of news. <a href="http://www.mingpaocanada.com/van/">Ming Pao Daily News</a>, one of the largest Chinese Language newspapers in North America whose materiality, history and printing lends an authoritative quality to the work. <a href="https://geohewitt.com/">Geo Hewitt</a>, who has been producing marking devices since 1898, and whose expertise allows us to bring forward old technology for new purposes. The content of <a href="https://thediscourse.ca/">Discourse Media</a>, a digital media platform publishing in-depth reporting on complex issues, explores new approaches to storytelling. And Finally, the work of artist <a href="https://heatherkaismith.com/">Heather Smith</a>, and illustrator <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mattblease/">Matt Blease</a>  whose timely, poignant work allows us to see the humor and multiplicity inherent in everyday life.</p>
